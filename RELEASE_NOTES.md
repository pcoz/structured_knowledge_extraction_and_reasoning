## 2026-06-21 (later still — DISPATCH)

### DISPATCH — computed (data-driven) calls

- **New opcode `DISPATCH table`** (`kb/execute.py`): pops an integer selector and
  runs the microtheory a jump table (`"sel:scope,…"`) maps it to — the computed
  sibling of `CALL`. The candidate set is DATA (the table), not branches baked into
  the program: a vtable / interpreter-opcode-table / state-machine transition.
  Decidable (a table lookup); an unmapped or fractional selector is a refusal
  (`ExecError`), never a silent default. Added to the closed set and to the
  transpiler's interpreter-only set (its target is chosen at run time, like `CALL`).
- **Worked examples** —
  `microtheory/dispatch.py` (#18): the *choice* of computation is a cited policy
  fact; one engine, open/closed extension (new operation = a microtheory + a table
  row).
  `microtheory/decisioning.py` (#19, capstone): five interacting decision systems —
  an external sanctions screen (`OPAQUE`), a channel router, per-rail risk models
  (parametric `FETCH`), a tier classifier (`CALL`), an action policy — with **no
  business branch in the orchestrator**. The cited data routes itself and the
  correct, fully-cited decision resolves itself.
- **Motivation** — modelling call resolution as a *sub-SKEAR*: an ambiguous
  `x.Foo()` becomes a *decidable* edge once the receiver's type is supplied as a
  cited fact and `DISPATCH` selects the target. The resolution is HARD; the only
  softness is that one type fact (oracle or learned) — see CodeGuard `docs/AMBIGUITY.md`.
- Executor self-test extended (DISPATCH select / refuse-unmapped / refuse-fractional);
  `docs/ORDERED_MICROTHEORIES.md` §8f + opcode table updated; `README.md` example
  count updated. All examples green.

## 2026-06-21 (later still — OPAQUE)

### OPAQUE — acknowledged black boxes; modelling whole systems

`OPAQUE` is the honest boundary of the verifiable core: a DECLARED black box (an
external service, an ML model, a transcendental, a legacy module) whose internals
SKEAR does not model. This lets a whole SYSTEM be represented — not just its
verifiable parts — as queryable, reason-over-able, cited knowledge.

- **Executor** (`kb/execute.py`) — `OPAQUE label`. The executor will NOT invent its
  result: with no value supplied it **REFUSES** the step (exactness preserved); given
  one via `run(..., oracles={label: value})` it pushes that value and records it in the
  new `ExecResult.opaque` list as UNVERIFIED, so provenance separates cited/verified
  facts from trusted black-box output. `OPAQUE` is declarable and auditable but never
  silently executed — so it can't become an escape hatch. (OPCODES 32 → 33.)
- **Transpiler** — `OPAQUE` is non-executable, so it joins the interpreter-only set.
- **Worked examples** —
  `microtheory/architecture.py` (#16): model a loan-origination system with `OPAQUE`
  components, then open the black boxes one by one — recursively (opening one can reveal
  a deeper one) — until the system has complete, deterministic, fully-cited detail.
  `microtheory/distributed_architecture.py` (#17): a payments platform's architecture as
  cited knowledge — the CALL/OPAQUE graph extracted from the programs-as-data, then the
  graph-spanning questions an architect dreads (full trust boundary, a black box's blast
  radius, PII flowing into a black box, side-effect reach) answered as queries and
  derivations over one cited KB.
- **Docs** — `docs/ORDERED_MICROTHEORIES.md` (opcode table + new §8e),
  `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `docs/NOVELTIES.md`, `README.md` updated; both examples
  cross-linked.

---

## 2026-06-21 (later still)

### Higher-order opcodes — MAP / FILTER / FOLD

The executor gains the functional/collection sibling of its imperative loops:
higher-order opcodes that apply an ordered microtheory across a bounded range
`[0, n)`. The per-element function is itself a named microtheory (composition,
element-wise), so reduce/map/filter become first-class — the SKEAR equivalents of
`Aggregate`/`Select`/`Where`.

- **Executor** (`kb/execute.py`) — `FOLD s` (pop `seed`, `n`; reduce `acc = s(acc, i)`
  over the range), `MAP s` (EMIT `s(i)` across the range — a produced sequence), and
  `FILTER s` (EMIT the `i` a predicate accepts). Each element runs the named scope to
  completion via a nested `run()` — the same engine, recursively — with inputs `{acc, i}`
  (FOLD) or `{i}` (MAP/FILTER). Bounded by `n`, every iteration counts against the step
  budget (termination preserved); a negative count is refused. The per-element
  microtheory's `FETCH`es flow up into the aggregate's cited `reads`. (OPCODES 29 → 32.)
- **Transpiler** (`kb/transpile.py`) — `MAP`/`FILTER`/`FOLD` join the interpreter-only
  set (they drive a nested interpreter per element).
- **Worked examples** —
  `microtheory/higher_order.py` (#14): reduce/map/filter over a cited loan series —
  compound balance (`FOLD`), accrual schedule (`MAP`), threshold screening (`FILTER`).
  `microtheory/lending_engine.py` (#15): a second whole-engine capstone — a lending
  decision using EVERY faculty including higher-order (bitwise entitlement gates a
  `FOLD`-compounded balance; `MAP` schedule; `FILTER` review; query; reason; conflict;
  transpile), every answer cited.
- **Docs** — `docs/ORDERED_MICROTHEORIES.md` (opcode table + new §8d),
  `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `docs/NOVELTIES.md`, `README.md` updated; both examples
  cross-linked.

---

## 2026-06-21 (later)

### Bitwise opcodes — flags, masks, and sets

The executor gains a bitwise opcode family — `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT`, `SHL`,
`SHR` — the integer-logic sibling of the arithmetic ops. A great deal of real
business and regulatory knowledge is encoded as bit flags and masks (permission /
entitlement sets, eligibility checklists, risk-category sets, schedules, packed
fields), and the rules over them are bitwise; they could not previously live as
ordered microtheories. Now they can, with the same closed-set / deterministic /
terminating guarantees.

- **Executor** (`kb/execute.py`) — `AND`/`OR`/`XOR`/`NOT`/`SHL`/`SHR` added to the
  closed `OPCODES` set (23 → 29 opcodes). Bitwise is **integer** logic: operands
  are coerced to whole numbers and a **fractional operand is REFUSED** (`ExecError`),
  not silently floored — the same stance as DIV-by-zero. `NOT` is two's-complement
  and width-free (`NOT n == -(n+1)`), so `x AND (NOT mask)` clears exactly the mask;
  shift counts must be `>= 0`. New self-tests cover each op, the clear-bits idiom,
  fractional-operand refusal, and negative-shift refusal.
- **Transpiler** (`kb/transpile.py`) — the bitwise ops join `CALL`/`FETCH`/`EMIT`
  in `_UNSUPPORTED`: they fall back to the interpreter (whose integer-coercion /
  refusal semantics the float-native transpiled form would not preserve exactly).
- **Worked examples** —
  `microtheory/bitwise.py` (#12): flags / masks / sets as cited knowledge —
  entitlement (`AND`), role union (`OR`), suspend (`NOT`+`AND`), what-changed
  (`XOR`), eligibility superset (`AND`+`==`), schedule (`SHL`), packed-field unpack
  (`SHR`) — each computed over cited domain facts.
  `microtheory/decision_engine.py` (#13): the GRAND capstone — a self-contained
  clinical prescribing decision engine using EVERY faculty at once (query; reason
  to fixpoint; execute with bitwise entitlement, recursive dosing, and an EMITted
  audit trail; conflict detection; transpile), every answer cited.
- **Docs** — `docs/ORDERED_MICROTHEORIES.md` (opcode table + new §8c),
  `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `docs/NOVELTIES.md`, `README.md` updated; both new
  examples cross-linked into the run lists.

---

## 2026-06-21

### Parametric `FETCH` — one rule, every entity

The executor's `FETCH` opcode gains a **parametric subject** form,
`FETCH @var|relation`, alongside the existing literal `FETCH subject|relation`.
The subject is resolved at run time from a local frame variable (an entity id
supplied as a run input), so a single ordered microtheory can be written once
over a generic entity and executed against any concrete one — a per-customer
rule whose `customer_id` is an input, rather than a program with a subject baked
into the operand. Backward compatible: literal FETCH is unchanged.

- **Executor** (`kb/execute.py`) — the FETCH handler resolves a leading `@` in
  the operand's subject against `frame.variables`; an unset variable is a
  controlled `ExecError` (the same safe-by-construction refusal as an unknown
  opcode). Input normalisation now keeps a **non-numeric** input verbatim (an
  entity id is a subject, not a quantity) while numeric inputs still become
  floats, so the arithmetic hot path stays float-only. The resolved subject is
  cited in `result.reads` exactly like a literal FETCH — provenance names the
  concrete entity, never `@var`.
- **Transpiler** (`kb/transpile.py`) — unchanged: `FETCH` already falls back to
  the interpreter, so parametric FETCH is covered with no transpiler change.
- **Worked example** (`microtheory/parametric.py`, example #11) — one
  `loan_offer` rule run against three customers with no rewrite; editing one
  customer's fact updates only that customer's answer; and the rule's per-entity
  FETCH surface, resolved over its own triples, is shown provably equal to what
  execution reads (a rule's data dependencies are themselves inspectable
  knowledge).
- **Docs** — `docs/ORDERED_MICROTHEORIES.md` (opcode table + new §8b),
  `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` (code map), `docs/NOVELTIES.md`, and `README.md`
  updated; the new example cross-linked into the run lists.

---

## 2026-06-18

### Ordered microtheories, an executor, and a transpiler (computation-as-data)

Microtheories gain an optional order (`Triple.seq`), turning a scoped *set* of
facts into a scoped *sequence* — a procedure, or, when its members are opcodes,
an executable program. This adds a third operational faculty alongside query and
reason, and makes computation itself first-class, inspectable, cited knowledge.

- **Core schema** — `Triple.seq` (optional, `None` = unordered, fully backward-
  compatible) in `kb/query.py` and `kb/extract.py`; `KB.in_scope(scope,
  ordered=True)` and `KB.ordered_scope(scope)` read a microtheory in step order.
- **Executor** (`kb/execute.py`) — a stack VM over a CLOSED instruction set
  (arithmetic, comparison, `LOAD`/`STORE`/`PUSH`, `DUP`/`SWAP`/`POP`, `JMP`/`JZ`,
  `CALL` for composition/recursion, `RET`, `EMIT` for sequence output, and
  `FETCH` to read the KB's own facts). Compile-once caching, opt-in trace,
  refusal of unknown opcodes, and step/recursion budgets guaranteeing termination.
- **Transpiler** (`kb/transpile.py`) — compiles a program to native Python
  (basic-block + SSA codegen), ~32× the interpreter and ~4× native, with
  automatic interpreter fallback for the unsupported subset. The triples stay
  canonical; the generated Python is a derived, inspectable cache.
- **Eight worked examples** in `src/microtheory/` (#3–#10): `procedure` (a
  procedure is an ordered microtheory; precedence closure + cycle detection via
  the real reasoner), `program` (code-as-data), `replicate` (exact replication of
  real Python + honest efficiency), `showcase` (recursion, mutual recursion,
  composition, FizzBuzz/primes via `EMIT`), `unified` (algorithm and data in one
  KB), `complexity` (an O(M²)→O(M) join — a polynomial speedup from the intrinsic
  index), `paradigm` (the provenance-native capstone), and `fraud` (end-to-end
  fraud detection: query + a data-defined risk score + reasoned ring detection,
  every flag cited). All assertion-backed.
- **Docs** — new full guide `docs/ORDERED_MICROTHEORIES.md`; `NOVELTIES.md`
  (novelty #7, computation-as-data) and its table/open-problems, `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` (code map + example tree), `README.md`, and all `See also`
  nav blocks cross-linked; `microtheory/test_scope.py` extended for ordered
  semantics.

---

## 2026-06-15

### New example suite: ingestion / import-consistency (`src/ingestion/`)

A seventh demo suite for the **import** problem: merging data from several
"authoritative" sources into one record and discovering the result is
self-contradictory. Four vendor/CMMS/audit exports for one asset load
without error, but computing the logical closure on import surfaces three
contradictions — a functional violation (two rated flows), a direct
disjoint-class clash (in-service vs decommissioned), and a **latent** one
that no single triple reveals: the subclass closure proves the asset is
both a rotodynamic and a positive-displacement machine. Each is traced
back to the exact source sentences via the derivation trail, and the demo
shows the genuine difficulty of importing anyway (resolve-with-data-loss
vs surface-for-review) and why scoping these as microtheories would be the
wrong fix (they are data errors, not legitimate framings). Assert-backed;
run `python -m ingestion.analyse` from `src/`.

### Feature: first-class microtheory / framing scope (`Triple.scope`)

Added an optional `scope` tag to `Triple` (`src/kb/query.py` and
`src/kb/extract.py`), the lightweight per-fact analogue of Cyc
microtheories. `scope is None` = GLOBAL (holds in every context — the v1
default, so existing KBs and JSON files load unchanged). A non-None scope
means the fact holds only within that named context — a legal framing
(plaintiff vs defendant), a standards interpretation, an ideological or
methodological school.

- **Scope-aware conflict detection.** Functional / inverse-functional
  conflict detection now skips pairs that live in *different* non-global
  scopes — they hold in different microtheories and are not in
  contradiction (global facts can still conflict with anything). The same
  subject can therefore carry incompatible classifications under different
  framings without being flagged, and the disagreement is preserved as
  queryable data.
- **Query.** `KB.in_scope(scope)` returns the facts visible in a
  microtheory (those tagged with it + global facts); `KB.scopes()` lists
  the named microtheories present.
- **Identity.** `scope` is part of a fact's identity — corroboration /
  dedup keys include it, so the same `(s, r, o)` asserted in two framings
  are kept distinct. `KB.load` accepts the new key and defaults it to
  None for older JSON.

Closes the microtheory gap previously noted in the README Cyc comparison.
Worked example: `src/microtheory/` (see below). Regression: existing
2,169-triple KB loads unchanged (all `scope=None`); purify demo unchanged
(29-fact canonical KB); Pluto classification still correct; diachronic
demo unaffected.

### Fix: inverse-functional conflict detector used `intersects` after import swap

A previous commit switched the conflict detectors' import to
`strictly_overlaps` but the *inverse-functional* call site still called
`intersects`, which would `NameError` on any inverse-functional conflict
path. Corrected to `strictly_overlaps` (and verified on a shared-identifier
case).

### Fix: year-boundary date ordering + succession-aware conflict detection

Two related temporal-correctness fixes (`src/kb/temporal.py`,
`src/kb/ontology_rules.py`):

- **`_parse_date` was non-monotonic at year boundaries.** With a `*31`
  month stride the maximum intra-year offset is `11*31 + 30 = 371`,
  which exceeded the `y*366` year stride — so late-December dates
  (Dec 26–31) sorted *after* the following January. This silently
  corrupted `intersects` / `before` / `after` / `during` for any
  interval touching a year-end. Reworked to an ordering-only scheme
  (`32`/month, `384`/year) whose year stride strictly exceeds the max
  intra-year offset (382). Only relative order is used anywhere, so the
  magnitude change is safe.
- **Added `temporal.strictly_overlaps`** (positive-duration overlap;
  excludes Allen "meets"/touching boundaries) and switched
  functional / inverse-functional conflict detection to it. A value
  that ends exactly where its successor begins is now treated as a
  clean succession, not a contradiction. `intersects` keeps its
  permissive "meets"-inclusive semantics for temporal propagation.

Docs: `_parse_date`, `intersects`, `strictly_overlaps`,
`_compile_functional`, and `Ontology.functional_property` docstrings
updated; `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` temporal section notes the
intersects-vs-strictly_overlaps distinction and the succession
convention. Regression: the `distill.purify` demo is unchanged
(29-fact canonical KB, 28 conflicts), the Pluto Planet-vs-DwarfPlanet
classification remains correctly exempt, and genuine same-period
conflicts are still caught. (Correction: this stride change also
desynced the diachronic demo, which hardcoded the old `*366` scale for
era boundaries — caught by a later end-to-end reproducibility run and
fixed; see below.)

### Fix: diachronic era bucketing desynced from the `_parse_date` stride

`diachronic/analyse.py:_facts_in_era` scaled era-boundary years with a
hardcoded `year * 366`, a copy of `_parse_date`'s old internal constant.
After the year-boundary fix moved `_parse_date` to a 384 stride, triple
dates and era boundaries were on different scales, so facts bucketed into
the wrong eras and the "indivisible affirmed-then-rejected" assertion
failed. Now derived from the temporal module's `_YEAR_STRIDE` (single
source of truth; handles signed/BCE years). The Scenario-3 trajectory is
correct again (affirmed Greek→Daltonian, rejected Rutherford→Quantum).
Lesson logged: verify demos by exit code, not just tail output.

## 2026-05-12

### New example suite: diachronic analysis (changing patterns of thinking)

Added `src/diachronic/` — a fifth demo suite tracking how the same
subject material has been *assembled differently* across historical
eras. The atom is the worked example: 2,500 years of natural
philosophy and science, six distinct paradigms, the same word with
genuinely different IS_A classifications, properties, and organising
vocabulary in each period.

  - `src/diachronic/corpus.py` — ~60 dated triples from primary
    sources across Greek atomism, Aristotelian rejection, Newtonian
    mechanics, Daltonian chemistry, Rutherford/Bohr, and quantum
    mechanics. Per-source authority weights, temporal slots on every
    fact, schema-as-data: the IS_A class itself shifts across eras.

  - `src/diachronic/analyse.py` — analyzer that surfaces per-era
    snapshots, schema drift (which IS_A classifications appeared /
    retired in each era), property reversals (the affirmed-for-
    2,000-years-then-rejected trajectory of "indivisible"),
    vocabulary drift (Jaccard distance across organising verbs),
    and authorial lineages.

  - Crucially, the analyzer prints prose alongside its output
    explaining *why* this kind of representation matters for
    knowledge representation, and *why* LLMs struggle specifically:
    era-mixing (blending all training data into one answer),
    reversal-erasure (smoothing over paradigm shifts), schema-
    flattening (losing the structural fact that the IS_A class
    itself changed). The demo is teaching material as well as a
    capability showcase.

  - Five assertion-backed stress scenarios pin the analyzer's
    properties: multi-era coverage, distinct IS_A class sets per
    era, the indivisibility reversal trajectory, temporal scoping
    preventing flattening into conflict, and measurable vocabulary
    drift across eras.

Documentation updates: README adds a fifth demo section; the
ARCHITECTURE.md cross-domain table now lists diachronic analysis;
USE_CASES.md adds a new category (40–43) covering history of
science, evolving legal interpretation, evolving medical
understanding, and contested-terminology tracking; DEVELOPER_GUIDE
adds the suite to the code map and testing section.

### Project name: SKEAR

The project now goes by SKEAR (Structured Knowledge Extraction And
Reasoning) — a short, pronounceable acronym derived from the full
name. The repository slug remains
`structured_knowledge_extraction_and_reasoning`; only the doc-
visible naming changed.

The acronym foregrounds the architectural posture the docs already
described: AI optionally augments construction (extraction,
curation, OWL DL reasoning via the HermiT adapter), and no AI is in
the loop at query time. README and every doc heading were updated.

### HermiT (OWL DL) integration shipped

Pattern A from `docs/COMPARISONS.md` (CYC / OWL DL section), made
real. A construction-time enricher that translates our `Ontology` +
`KB` into OWL/RDF, invokes a real description-logic reasoner (HermiT
by default, Pellet alternative via `owlready2`), and converts
inferred facts back to our `Triple` / `Derivation` shape. Runtime is
unchanged — the shipped artifact is still pure JSON.

**Soft dependencies** — adapter loads cleanly without them and
raises actionable errors only when invoked:
  - `owlready2` (Python, `pip install owlready2`)
  - Java JVM (system, OpenJDK 17 recommended)

**What HermiT adds** (over the existing compile-to-rules backend):
  - Cardinality restrictions (`min/max/exactCardinality` axioms,
    qualified or unqualified).
  - Complex class expressions (intersection, union, complement,
    someValuesFrom, allValuesFrom).
  - Full DL classification — inferred class hierarchies that
    closed-world Horn rules can't compute.
  - Inconsistency detection — HermiT throws on unsatisfiable
    axioms + ABox; we catch and surface as `CONTRADICTION_DETECTED`.

**Ontology DSL extensions** (`src/kb/ontology.py`):
  - `.cardinality(prop, exactly=N, min=N, max=N, of=ClassName)`
  - `.class_intersection(name, *parts)`
  - `.class_union(name, *parts)`
  - `.class_complement(name, of)`
  - `.class_some_values(name, prop, target)`
  - `.class_all_values(name, prop, target)`

These methods are captured by the `Ontology` dataclass but
deliberately not compiled by `ontology_rules.py` — they require
open-world DL semantics and are consumed exclusively by
`ontology_owl.hermit_enrich`.

**Adapter implementation** (`src/kb/ontology_owl.py`, ~480 LoC):
  - Translation layer: classes, properties, axioms, individuals.
  - Bidirectional name sanitisation (entities with spaces /
    punctuation / Unicode → valid Python identifiers → original
    names restored on the way back).
  - Per-call `owlready2.World()` for namespace isolation across
    successive invocations.
  - `AllDifferent` asserted by default (unique-name posture) so
    cardinality constraints aren't trivially satisfied by name
    coalescing.
  - `INDIRECT_is_a` used to read inferences (vs the asserted
    `is_a`).
  - Public API: `hermit_enrich(kb, ontology) → (kb, derivs, info)`
    and `hermit_rule(ontology, stratum=5)` for engine integration.

**Seven assertion-backed stress scenarios** in
`src/kb/ontology_owl.py:_stress_test()`, verified against the real
HermiT reasoner on a t3.medium EC2:
  1. Subclass-chain DL classification.
  2. Cardinality violation (4 vertices vs exactly=3 → inconsistent).
  3. Cardinality satisfied.
  4. Class intersection inference.
  5. Disjoint-class inconsistency.
  6. someValuesFrom inference.
  7. Per-call World isolation (no state leak across invocations).

**All four example suites augmented** with optional HermiT sections
that demonstrate DL-only capability while soft-failing on hosts
without owlready2 / Java:
  - `src/kb/reason.py`: ClassicalPhilosopher ≡ Philosopher ⊓
    AncientGreek; Aristotle and Plato inferred, Descartes correctly
    excluded.
  - `src/ahab/reason.py`: ConfrontationalUtterance disjoint with
    IntrospectiveUtterance; 30 utterances verified consistent.
  - `src/git_rag/reason.py`: SafeOp disjoint with RiskyOp; 21 + 16
    items verified coherent.
  - `src/distill/purify.py`: atemporal Pluto edge case — HermiT
    proves inconsistency without temporal scoping, validating the
    main pipeline's temporal-layer design.

**Documentation**: `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` (code map + recipe +
testing section), `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (Layer-2 description),
`docs/COMPARISONS.md` (CYC OWL DL adapter section — "planned" →
"shipped" + verified capability list).

### New example suite: knowledge distillation / purification

Added `src/distill/` — a fourth demo suite focused on the canonical
"noisy in, clean out" workflow that the temporal + confidence +
conflict capabilities now enable end-to-end.

  - `src/distill/corpus.py` — a deliberately-noisy multi-source
    astronomical-facts corpus (~65 facts from seven fictional sources
    of varying authority: IAU_2023, NASA_factsheet, peer-reviewed
    paper, britannica_1985, old_encyclopedia_1965, textbook_2010,
    blog_post). The corpus is engineered to exhibit every pathology
    the purification pipeline targets — corroborated multi-source
    agreement, functional-property conflicts (different masses for
    the same body), outdated measurements (Andromeda's distance
    progressively revised from 1.0e6 to 2.5e6 light-years), and
    low-authority noise standing alone.

  - `src/distill/purify.py` — the full pipeline: OWL conflict
    detection → ChainPolicy resolution (Authority → Latest →
    HighestConfidence → SurfaceForReview) → multi-source
    corroboration boost (noisy-OR) → confidence-threshold pruning →
    marker cleanup. Returns a clean canonical KB plus a
    `PurificationReport` describing what was changed and why. Six
    assertion-backed stress scenarios.

End-to-end on the bundled corpus: 66 → 29 triples, 28 functional-
property conflicts detected, 15 multi-source groups merged, 3
standalone low-confidence facts pruned. The famous Pluto edge case
behaves correctly: classifications Planet (valid until 2006-08-23)
and DwarfPlanet (valid from 2006-08-24) are temporally disjoint and
NOT flagged as a conflict — both survive as facts of different eras.

Documentation updated:
  - `README.md`: new demo description; three new "Who this is for"
    rows covering multi-source reconciliation, time-varying facts,
    and disputed-information audit trails.
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: distillation row added to the
    "Extending to new domains" table.
  - `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`: distill/ added to the code map; the
    six stress scenarios listed in the testing section.

### General-purpose engine extensions: OWL DSL, temporal, uncertainty, conflicts

Closed three architectural gaps that mattered for the engine being a
general-purpose reasoning facility rather than a narrow demo. Schema-
compatible throughout — existing JSON KBs load unchanged.

**OWL ontology DSL (`src/kb/ontology.py`, `src/kb/ontology_rules.py`):**
A small declarative DSL for OWL-style axioms — classes, properties,
sub-class / sub-property hierarchy, transitive / symmetric / inverse
/ functional / inverse-functional properties, equivalent / disjoint
classes, domain / range. The compiler emits standard `Rule` objects
into the existing engine; closed-world; no external DL reasoner.
Functional / inverse-functional axioms emit `CONFLICT_*` markers
consumed by the conflict module. Eleven stress-test scenarios pin
the compiler's behaviour. Earlier in the day the OWL DSL was
introduced without functional/inverse-functional axioms — those are
added now.

**Temporal slots + Allen algebra (`src/kb/temporal.py`):**
Optional `valid_from` / `valid_to` fields on every Triple (ISO date
strings; None = unbounded). Full Allen interval algebra (13 atomic
relations + composition table + relation inversion). The lenient
`intersects` predicate is used by the engine and the conflict
detector for "do these triples coexist in time?" tests. The engine
intersects input intervals when propagating temporal validity
through derivations; temporally inconsistent inputs silently
suppress the derivation. Date parser handles full ISO, year-month,
year-only, and BC forms.

**Confidence / uncertainty (`src/kb/confidence.py`):**
Optional `confidence` field on every Triple (float in [0.0, 1.0],
default 1.0). Combinators: `noisy_and` (default, product), `min`
(weakest-link), `noisy_or` (independent-evidence). `derive_confidence`
accepts a mode string or a caller-supplied callable. Engine
propagates input confidences through derivations via noisy-AND when
its `propagate_confidence` flag is set (default on). Multiple
semantic interpretations of the number — probabilistic, fuzzy,
subjective-Bayesian, partial-belief — equally well-supported; the
combinators don't prescribe a reading.

**Conflict detection + resolution (`src/kb/conflict.py`):**
`detect_conflicts` reads the `CONFLICT_*` and `CONTRADICTION_DETECTED`
markers produced by the OWL rules. Six pluggable policies:
`LatestWinsPolicy` (latest `valid_from`), `HighestConfidencePolicy`,
`AuthorityWinsPolicy` (uses `KB.source_authority`), `KeepAllPolicy`,
`SurfaceForReviewPolicy` (keeps everything + emits
`CONFLICT_UNRESOLVED` markers), `ChainPolicy` (try each in order;
first to narrow wins). `apply_with_conflict_resolution` orchestrates
the full pipeline: fixpoint inference → conflict detection →
resolution → clean resolved KB. Eleven stress-test scenarios pin
behaviour across temporal overlap, source-authority ranking,
confidence-based resolution, and disjoint-class contradiction.

**Engine wiring (`src/kb/reason.py`):**
`apply_all_rules_to_fixpoint` gained two opt-in flags
(`propagate_confidence=True`, `propagate_temporal=True`, both
default on) and a `confidence_mode` parameter. Propagation is a
dispatcher-level wrapper — existing rules require no changes. With
default-confidence (1.0) and unbounded-temporal (None/None) inputs
the propagation is a no-op, so v1 triples flow through unchanged.
`KB.source_authority` was added (default empty dict) and `KB.load`
preserves it across the fixpoint rebuild. `KB.load` is also more
forgiving — filters unknown keys and applies defaults for missing
optional fields, so old JSON keeps working forever.

**Schema (`src/kb/query.py`):**
`Triple` gained optional `valid_from`, `valid_to`, `confidence`
fields. `KB` gained an optional `source_authority` dict. Both
backward-compatible via defaults; old JSON files load unchanged.

**Documentation:**
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: extended Layer-2 description with the
  temporal / uncertainty / conflict mechanisms; new glossary
  entries for Interval, Allen relation, Confidence, Conflict,
  Policy, Ontology.
- `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`: code map adds temporal.py,
  confidence.py, ontology.py, ontology_rules.py, conflict.py;
  four new recipes (OWL ontology, temporal slots, confidence,
  conflict resolution); testing section names all three
  stress-test suites (32 assertions total).
- `docs/COMPARISONS.md`: CYC inference-power bullet rewritten;
  summary-table "Formal reasoning" cell now reflects the full
  capability surface.
- `docs/NOVELTIES.md`: "demonstrated vs claimed" table adds rows
  for temporal validity, uncertainty, and conflict resolution.
- `README.md`: capability bullets reflect time-aware queries and
  conflict-resolution policies.

### Reasoning-engine extension

Extended `src/kb/reason.py` beyond single-pass Horn to cover the three
capabilities flagged as missing in the CYC comparison
(`docs/COMPARISONS.md`):

- **Fixpoint iteration** via `apply_all_rules_to_fixpoint`. Rules run
  in ascending stratum order; within each stratum, iteration
  continues until no new facts are derived. Includes a divergence
  guard that raises `RuntimeError` rather than silently truncating
  at `max_iter`.
- **Disjunctive rules** via the new `DisjunctiveRule` dataclass —
  declarative form for the "alternative antecedent relations, one
  consequent" pattern. Compiles to a standard `Rule`.
- **Stratified negation-as-failure** via the `kb_has` helper and the
  `stratum` field on `Rule`. Rules at stratum ≥ 1 see only the
  closure of lower strata, keeping the result deterministic despite
  negation being non-monotonic. Arbitrary stratum depths supported.

Rules added: R8 transitive intellectual descent, R9 disjunctive
`INFLUENCED_BY` (`TUTORED_BY ∪ INTELLECTUAL_DESCENDANT_OF`), R10
stratified `FAMILY_PROGENITOR`, R11 descent-extension bridge
(introduced after stress-test scenario 1 caught a transitive-closure
gap in R1 + R8 alone).

### Stress-test suite

Added `stress_test()` to `src/kb/reason.py`: 10 assertion-backed
synthetic scenarios covering deep chains, cycles, empty KB, alias
variants, ordering invariance, determinism, divergence detection,
multi-stratum dispatch. Five bugs caught and fixed:

- R1 + R8 alone underdetermine transitive IDO closure on chains
  longer than 3 (fixed with R11).
- `kb_has` did not canonicalise its subject (fixed).
- `r10_progenitor` could emit duplicate progenitors via alias
  variants (fixed by canonicalising the parent before dedupe).
- Stratum ≥ 2 silently ignored by the hardcoded 0/1 dispatcher
  (fixed by generalising to all strata in ascending order).
- No divergence guard — runaway rules would silently truncate at
  `max_iter` (fixed with a `for…else` raise).

### Cross-domain reasoners

Two new files demonstrating that the same engine generalises across
data shapes without modification:

- `src/ahab/reason.py` — applies the engine to the 35-utterance
  Moby-Dick corpus. Theme co-occurrence and transitive thematic
  reach (fixpoint over 4 rounds, 552 derivations), `HAS_SPEECH_LABEL`
  unifying speech-act ∪ mood (`DisjunctiveRule`), confrontational vs
  introspective classification (function-form disjunction over
  object values), peaceful-addressee derivation (negation over a
  derived predicate — `self` and `other captain` qualify).
- `src/git_rag/reason.py` — applies the engine to the 37-item Git
  knowledge base. Transitive `RELATED_TO` closure for multi-hop
  topic navigation, `NEEDS_OPERATOR_ATTENTION` via
  `HAS_CAUTION ∪ USES_DESTRUCTIVE_COMMAND` (`DisjunctiveRule`),
  `RECOVERY_OPERATION` classification, `SAFE_TO_AUTOMATE`
  (negation-as-failure over the derived attention flag — 21 items
  qualify).

### Documentation

- `docs/COMPARISONS.md`: CYC inference-power bullet rewritten to
  reflect the engine's actual capability set (fixpoint + disjunction
  + stratified negation, no DL subsumption, no full FOL).
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: glossary entries added for *Fixpoint*,
  *Stratified Negation*, *Disjunctive Rule*; Layer-2 inference
  description updated to reflect fixpoint dispatch.
- `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`: rule-adding recipes use the `Rule`
  dataclass; new recipes for `DisjunctiveRule` and
  negation-as-failure; code map extended with the new reasoner
  files; testing section notes the stress-test suite.

## 2026-05-11

### Upstream research (source research repository) — 12:48 – 15:00

Work in the upstream research repository that produced the
components later extracted into this public release:

- **12:48–13:33** — Foundational primitives: interaction-type
  encoder; flavour-detection prototype (7/7 article classification);
  cell-grammar extended to 17/17 phenocrysts; cross-context
  cell-grammar combining flavour and interaction-type.
- **13:22** — Aristotle generalisation test (honest negative result
  that informed the later combinatorial-construction framing).
- **14:30–14:33** — `kb_scale_experiment` at 1,000 Wikipedia
  articles: canonicalisation of entities, modern-date handling,
  richer queries. Output: the canonical 1,000-article KB used in
  this repo (`src/kb/kb_1000_articles.json`).
- **14:36** — KB persistence layer + query CLI + manual patches
  bringing the base graph to 2,169 triples and 2,561 entities.
- **14:39** — `kb_reasoning.py`: deductive inference with Horn-clause
  rules and `since A therefore B` provenance trails. Output: derived
  facts dataset (`src/kb/kb_1000_articles_extended.json`).
- **14:51** — `moby_dick_ahab/`: conversational generation grounded
  in Melville's corpus. 35 curated quotes, theme-matched retrieval.
- **14:58** — `enterprise_rag/`: Git-manual RAG demo. 37 curated KB
  items, intent + topic matching. NOVELTIES.md added.
- **15:00** — Documentation scrub: removed hedging phrases and
  dated work references.

### This repository — 15:23 – 18:13

Extraction of the above into a clean, public-facing release plus
iterative documentation work.

- **15:23** — `e889bf3` — Initial commit. Code under `src/` with
  three runnable demonstrations (Wikipedia KB, Captain Ahab, Git
  manual RAG). Pre-built KB JSON files included.
- **15:28** — `a291b0d` — Added `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`: code map,
  data model, API quickref, recipes, troubleshooting.
- **15:36** — `572700a`, `1f73e70` — Added `docs/COMPARISONS.md`
  (side-by-side with vector RAG, GraphRAG, LLM-as-KB, Wikidata,
  OpenIE, FrameNet, CYC, Neo4j, BERT event extraction). Scrubbed
  residual jargon from `docs/NOVELTIES.md`.
- **15:39** — `8302ac3` — Cross-linked all documents with a
  consistent `See also` navigation block.
- **15:44** — `cb8525c` — Added `docs/USE_CASES.md`: 21 use cases
  grouped by criticality (regulated, technical, customer-facing,
  internal knowledge, research, brand), each with current approach
  / where it falls short / how this addresses it / implementation
  sketch / what's gained. Plus an explicit "where this does NOT
  replace LLMs" section.
- **15:48** — `c65db4c` — README H1 title-cased.
- **17:35** — `8989346` — `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` extended with an
  explanation of the combinatorial construction pattern (regex +
  curated patches + AI extraction) and why imperfection in any
  single component does not matter.
- **17:37** — `80085e8` — `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` extended with
  seven AI-assisted maintenance workflows (coverage review, drift
  audit, alias-map curation, inference-rule mining, ambiguity
  triage, schema migration, regression testing).
- **17:39** — `0f43d55` — `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` extended with an
  explanation of how the system remains auditable, deterministic
  and non-hallucinatory even though AI is used at construction time.
- **17:41** — `b0c6919` — Reframed AI's role across documentation
  as *knowledge extractor into a consistent, structured format* —
  not *editor of the runtime*.
- **17:52** — `e0574e8` — Consistency pass: standardised paths
  (everything relative to repo root, `src/` prefixed), unified
  terminology, fixed `PROJECT_ROOT` resolution in
  `src/wikipedia_utils.py`.
- **18:10** — `0e2cd2e` — README rewritten for a business audience.
  Opens with the problem (hallucination, no audit trail,
  non-determinism), states the value proposition in plain language,
  describes the three demos at a high level, routes technical
  readers to `docs/`.
- **18:13** — `33fafca` — Obfuscated the licensing contact address
  in README and LICENSE to deter scrapers.
